Hello, and thank you for visiting my page. My name is Vivian McCarty and I'm a technical writer who creates developer documentation. I'm passionate about technology, I love to write, and I have a knack for design.

I'm a native Texan who spent some years in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently back in Texas and reside in the Austin area.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with my PC, playing video games, snowboarding, and building models. I also have a cat named Muffin who likes to be taken on walks in the evening.
