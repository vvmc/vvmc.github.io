I created this site using the following tools:
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/about/)

In Atom, I wrote in these markup languages:
* [HTML](https://html.com/)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

This site uses a Jekyll theme designed by [Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/). The architecture and code base for this theme are completely open source, enabling anyone to use and modify them. You can download it from Tom's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). Thanks, Tom!
