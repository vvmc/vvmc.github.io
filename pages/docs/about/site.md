I created this site using the following tools:
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/about/)

In Atom, I wrote in these markup languages:
* [HTML](https://html.com/)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

Tom Johnson designed this Jekyll theme for technical documentation as an alternative to using a structured content management system (CMS). Tom is a technical writer, blogger, and podcaster based in San Jose, California. The architecture and code base for this theme are completely open source, enabling anyone to use and modify them. Tom made this theme free to use. You can download it [here](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). What a cool guy. Thanks, Tom!
