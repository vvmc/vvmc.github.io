Tom Johnson is a technical writer, blogger, and podcaster based in San Jose, California. Tom designed this Jekyll theme as an alternative to using a structured CMS, like OxygenXML, for technical documentation. The architecture and code base for this theme are completely open, enabling anyone to modify them. Tom made this theme free to use, and you can download it [here](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). What a cool guy. Thanks, Tom!
