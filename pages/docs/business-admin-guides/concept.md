Duration activity pay helps you to pay employees for fixed-term activities and payment arrangements. You can associate activities with duration activity pay, and assign an employee with activities, date ranges, and payments. With our Student product, you can assign duration activity pay to an instructor teaching assigned course sections. Example: Assign an adjunct professor to teach Economics 101 for the Fall 2022 semester, and pay them an agreed-upon compensation on a schedule that matches the activity dates.

When the *Duration Activity Pay* business process completes, it generates a scheduled payments list that Payroll processes. The *Duration Activity Pay* business process doesn't support payroll integrations.
