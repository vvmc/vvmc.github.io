The topics in this section represent the kinds of business administrator guides that I wrote for Workday. I chose these topics because they exemplify:
* A complete section of an administrator guide.
* Conceptual information and instructive steps.
* Consistent usage of a style guide.
* Easy to follow instructions for complex features.
* Minimalism.

The original topics I wrote are protected by copyright. To bypass this limitation so I can share my work, I thoroughly altered the content before publishing on this site.

{% include note.html content="These are selected topics from a larger administrator guide. I disabled the hyperlinks to other topics. However, I chose to keep the blue text that’s associated with hyperlinks for a more genuine experience." %}
