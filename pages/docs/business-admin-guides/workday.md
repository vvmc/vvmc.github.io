The topics in this section represent the kinds of business administrator guides that I wrote for Workday. I chose these topics because they exemplify:
* Complete sections of an administrator guide.
* Conceptual information.
* Consistent usage of a style guide.
* Easy to follow instructions for complex features.
* Minimalism.

The original topics I wrote are protected by copyright law. To bypass this limitation so I could share my work, I thoroughly altered the content before publishing on this site.

{% include note.html content="These are selected topics from a larger administrator guide, the hyperlinks to other topics in the source don’t work. However, I chose to keep the blue text that’s associated with hyperlinks so that you might have greater context. Also, I used a custom style guide for these topics." %}
