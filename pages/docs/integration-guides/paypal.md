The following are integration guides that I wrote for PayPal:
* [Pay Later](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/pay-later/us/)
* [Native Checkout](https://developer.paypal.com/limited-release/native-checkout/)

I chose these topics because they exemplify:
* Conceptual information and instructive steps.
* Developer documentation.
* Graphic design (for Pay Later).
* Multiple programming languages.
