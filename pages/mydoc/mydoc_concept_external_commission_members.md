External commission members participate in commissions of your organization but aren't academic affiliates, admissions counselors, students, or workers. They can be people such as:
* Board of trustees members.
* Community members.
* Local business people.

External commission members don't have positions or supervisory organization assignments, but they can hold commission roles and participate in commission related business processes. You can create expense reports for external commission members, designate them as authorized bank signatories, and record their professional affiliations.

You can use segmented security to restrict access to external commission members':
* IDs.
* Names.
* Personal information.
