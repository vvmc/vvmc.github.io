You can designate a commission as a search commission, enabling it to play an active role in recruiting. Once you link a search commission with job requisitions, you can:
<ul>
<li>Integrate users with search commission roles into recruiting processes for associated job requisitions.</li>
<ul><li>You must configure your recruiting domains, business process definitions, and business process security policies to include role-based security groups associated with commission roles.</li></ul>
<li>Select commission members, who are workers, as interviewees on the <b>Schedule Interview Team</b> task.</li>
<li>Configure the <b>Commission</b> profile report on the Details for Job Requisition Composite View profile group.</li></ul>
