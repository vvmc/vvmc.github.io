I created this site using the following tools:
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/about/)

Other than Atom, this was my first experience using these tools.

In Atom, I wrote in these markup languages:
* [HTML](https://html.com/)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

I had a lot fun, I'm excited to create and publish additional web content in the future.
