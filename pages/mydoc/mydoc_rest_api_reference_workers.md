### Resource Description

### Endpoints
Collection of workers:
<div class="alert alert-success"><span class="label label-info">GET</span> /workers</div>
Individual worker:

#### View
* workerSummary is the default view for <span class="label label-info">GET</span> ```/workers```. This view displays limited information about a worker.
* workerProfile is the default view for <span class="label label-info">GET</span> ```/workers/{id}```. This view displays additional information about a worker.
* timeOffSummary displays the total hourly balance for hourly plans for a worker.

#### Search
The search query parameter searches worker names for matches. The search is case-insensitive and only matches names that start with that text. Example: These searches return Jackie Chan:
```json
/workers?search=jac

/workers?search=chan

/workers?search=Cha
```
But this search doesnâ€™t:
```json
/workers?search=ckie
```
You can also include multiple search texts. This search result includes Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan:
```json
/workers?search=jackie lee
```

### Schema
The following table lists the JSON name/value pairs returned in the response body for the workerSummary and workerProfile views. Unless specified, the values are strings. The body doesn't include empty value pairs. Additionally, pair orders can change, and we might introduce new pairs in patches between releases. Your application must respond to these changes.

| Name | workerSummary | workerProfile | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| descriptor | X | X | 	Display name of the object.<br/><br/>Depending on your configurations on the **Edit Tenant** task, the descriptor returns the worker's legal name, preferred name, or a concatenation of the legal and preferred. |
| id | X | X | Reference ID. |
| href | X | X | URL that represents the object. |
| businessTitle | X | X | |
| dateOfBirth | | X | |
| isManager | X | X | Boolean. |
| location | | X | Location object. |
| primarySupervisoryOrganization | X | X | Supervisory organization object. |
| primaryWorkAddressText | | X | |
| primaryWorkEmail | X | X | |
| primaryWorkPhone | X | X | |
| supervisoryOrganizationsManaged | | X | Supervisory organizations managed by the worker. |
| yearsOfService | | X | |

The timeOffSummary  view returns fewer JSON name/value pairs in the response body than the workerSummary view. However, the timeOffSummary view returns a worker's totalHourlyBalance.
