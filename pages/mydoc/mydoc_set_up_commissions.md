### Context
You can track various types of groups, including corporate, department, regulatory, or special subgroups. You can maintain commission memberships and meeting details to have a complete record of commission related activity.

You can classify a commission as private to restrict access to the commission, its members, and its meetings.

### Steps

1.  Access the **Maintain Commission Type** task.

    Create commission types for categorization purposes, such as faculty, student, or administrative. Selecting the **Search Commission** check box enables you to associate search commissions with job requisitions.

1. Access the **Maintain Organization Subtypes** task.

    Assign subtype levels to the commission organization type for reporting purposes. Subtypes are levels used in hierarchy-related calculated fields and in the definition of organization hierarchy structures.

1.  (Optional) Access the **Maintain Commission Classification Groups** task.

    Create groups that you can use to combine similar commission classifications for greater ease of reporting and usability, such as meeting frequency.

    See <span style="color: blue;">Create Role-Based Security Groups</span>.
1. (Optional) <span style="color: blue;">Create Organization Membership Security Groups (Constrained)</span>.

    Grant current members access to commission information by creating a constrained organization membership security group for the commission.

    Set up the commission profile and add its profile report to the sponsoring organization type profile.
1. <span style="color: blue;">Set Up Dashboards and Landing Pages</span>.
