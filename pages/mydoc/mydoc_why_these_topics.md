This site contains topics that I wrote for an Administrator Guide. I chose the topics in the **Commissions** and **Duration Activity Pay** sections because they exemplify:
* Complete sections of an administrator guide.
* Conceptual information.
* Consistent style in present tense and active voice.
* Easy to follow instructions for complex features.
* Minimalism.

I chose the **REST API Resources** documentation to exemplify:
* Ability to read JSON.
* API functional understanding.
* Examples that empathize with readers.
